- 👋 Hi, I’m @RouyesDev, graduated in business Administration and specialization in controlling and finance. I work with systems since a have 15 years old and now 
I want to learn how to make solutions that I needed as a user, as a dev of systems.
- 👀 I’m interested in learn all I can about programming and to apply all that knowledge for solutions in real business "problems". 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about analysis and development of systems on Fatec Ipiranga, no language specified, focus on logical and concepts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all I can have or develop interest with.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me an e-mail: anderson_rou@yahoo.com

Thanks
